# Surprising dynamics phenomena in Dielsâ€“Alder reaction of C60 uncovered with AI

- You need to install [MLatom 3.7+](https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom)
- Tutorial: https://xacs.xmu.edu.cn/docs/mlatom/tutorial_al.html

The theoretical backgroud and examples of the use of the active learning procedure is described at:

## Data

Active learning scripts, ML models, datasets, quasi-classical trajectories and analyses in the paper can be found in [https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25827175](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25827175).

## Code 

This repository is only for the purpose of archiving the original scripts. None of the script is going to be maintained as the users should use the released MLatom with more features. Models and data should still work with the new MLatoms.

You can find the development script used for the original study in [https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25827175](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25827175) (you still need to install MLatom for it to work!). The script if cleaned up and integrated into the official MLatom release, where many things changed.
